KEY/VALUE DATA

1. Insert or "put" values into the KV store:

root@vm-01:/usr/local/consul/consul.d# consul kv put redis/config/minconns 1
Success! Data written to: redis/config/minconns

root@vm-01:/usr/local/consul/consul.d# consul kv put redis/config/maxconns 25
Success! Data written to: redis/config/maxconns

root@vm-01:/usr/local/consul/consul.d# consul kv put -flags=42 redis/config/users/admin abcd1234
Success! Data written to: redis/config/users/admin

For the key "redis/config/users/admin", we set a flag value of 42. All keys support setting a 64-bit integer flag value.
This is not used internally by Consul, but it can be used by clients to add meaningful metadata to any KV.

2. get values from the KV store:

consul kv get -detailed redis/config/minconns

CreateIndex      521
Flags            0
Key              redis/config/minconns
LockIndex        0
ModifyIndex      521
Session          -
Value            1

3. list all the keys in the store using the recurse options

consul kv get -recurse
redis/config/maxconns:25
redis/config/minconns:1
redis/config/users/admin:abcd1234

4. To delete a key from the Consul KV store

consul kv delete redis/config/minconns
Success! Deleted key: redis/config/minconns

5. Delete an entire prefix using the recurse option:
consul kv delete -recurse redis
Success! Deleted keys with prefix: redis

6. To update the value of an existing key, "put" a value at the same path:
consul kv put redis/config/minconns 2
redis/config/minconns:2
